p. Project was generated from rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber-template with some modifications to get by a couple of errors caused by edge rails.
rails new deals -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber-template.rb -T


h1. Create Project
	* or check out tag v0.2.1

h3. rake cucumber:wip
	2 scenarios (2 failed)
	15 steps (2 failed, 8 skipped, 1 undefined, 4 passed)
	0m1.388s

	You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

	Then /^the deal should be saved$/ do
	  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
	end

h3. Implement Step Definitions
	/features/step_definitions/deal_steps.rb
	Then /^the deal should be saved$/ do
	  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
	end

h3. rake cucumber:wip

	p. Ok let's make this pass

	      Can't find mapping from "the new deal page" to a path.
	      Now, go and add a mapping in /Users/jonathanspooner/Dropbox/active/bdd/deals/features/support/paths.rb (RuntimeError)

	p. We don't need to add anything to paths.rb because we can just use the catch all path.

	begin
	  page_name =~ /the (.*) page/
	  ...
	rescue Object => e
	  raise "Can't find mapping from \"#{page_name}\" to a path.\n" +
	    "Now, go and add a mapping in #{__FILE__}"
	end
	
				 
h3. Let's make the mapping work for "the new deal page"

	routes.rb
	resources :deals

	and run rake cucumber:wip

	Scenario: Create a new deal                                                         # features/deals/create_deals.feature:12
	    Given I am on the new deal page                                                   # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
	      uninitialized constant DealsController (ActionController::RoutingError)
	      ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:45:in `/^(?:|I )am on (.+)$/'
	      features/deals/create_deals.feature:13:in `Given I am on the new deal page'


	p. Now the mapping works and cucumber is driving the next step.  It wants a DealsController!

h3. Generate the DealsController

	Okay let's cheat a little and use a rails generator to speed things up.
	BDD want's us todo this
	* rails g controller Deals new
	* rake cucumber:wip
	* RED When I fill in "Title" with "Mega skateboard deals" 
	* Add form to new.html
	* rake cucumber:wip
	* RED And I press "Create Deal"
	* Add DealsController#create
	
	This would be the right method with a very custom feature but this one is SUPER basic so we'll skip a few steps and use the scaffold generator.
	
	* be rails g scaffold deals title:string start_date:datetime end_date:datetime quantity:integer description:text number_sold:integer

	h4. No let's drop a down a gear and take a look at our specs.

	* Add default value for number_sold in 20110823170906_create_deals.rb
	* Add a spec for our default values.

	/spec/models/deal_spec.rb
	it { Deal.new.number_sold.should eql(0) }
  it { Deal.new.quantity.should eql(0) }
  
	* rake db:migrate
	* RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate
	* rake spec
	

	h4. Look at the deals_controller_spec
	
	* Let's use FactoryGirl to make our lives easier later.
	/spec/factory.rb
	Factory.define :deal do |d|
	  d.title 'Mega Skateboard deal'
	  d.start_date (Date.today-5).to_date
	  d.end_date (Date.today+5).to_date
	  d.description 'Mega ramp skateboard by Jake Brown is on sale.'
	  d.quantity 100
	  d.number_sold 0
	end
	
	/spec/controllers/deals_controller_spec.rb
	* "deal = Deal.create! valid_attributes" and replace with "deal = Factory(:deal)"
	
	Update valid_attributes to use FactoryGirl
	
	def valid_attributes
    {}
  end
	
	def valid_attributes
    Factory.attributes_for(:deal)
  end

	* rake spec - Everything should be green
	* now back to the BDD cycle


h3. rake cucumber:wip

When I fill in "Start date" with "2011/9/1"                                       
      cannot fill in, no text field, text area or password field with id, name, or label 'Start date' found *(Capybara::ElementNotFound)*

h3. The rails generator by default gives us select boxes but we want a text_field.

We'll update datetime_select with text_field for start_date and end_date.

h3. rake cucumber:wip


Then the deal should be saved
      TODO (Cucumber::Pending)
      ./features/step_definitions/deal_steps.rb:2:in `/^the deal should be saved$/'
      features/deals/create_deals.feature:19:in `Then the deal should be saved'


h3. Let's implement this step definition

/features/step_definitions/deal_steps.rb
Then /^the deal should be saved$/ do
  page.should have_content("Deal was successfully created.")
end

h3. rake cucumber:wip

Looks Green!                                                                   
Scenario: Create a new deal
    Given I am on the new deal page                                             
    When I fill in "Title" with "Mega skateboard deals"                         
    When I fill in "Start date" with "2011/9/1"                                 
    When I fill in "End date" with "2011/9/1"                                   
    When I fill in "Quantity" with "1000"                                       
    And I press "Create Deal"                                                   
    Then the deal should be saved                                               
    Then I should see "Mega skateboard deals"                                  
                                                                               

h3. Now let's move our @wip tag down and fix this "title can't be blank error" 

Then I should see "Title can't be blank" 

Looks like this should be valid so let's drop down a gear and update the Deal model.

h4. DealSpec

describe "validation" do
  it { Deal.new.should have(1).errors_on(:title) }    
end

h4. rake spec:models

Deal validation 
     Failure/Error: it { Deal.new.should have(1).errors_on(:title) }
       expected 1 errors on :title, got 0
     # ./spec/models/deal_spec.rb:9:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

h4. Deal.rb

  validates_presence_of :title

h4. rake spec:models

Finished in 1.73 seconds
16 examples, 0 failures

Looking Green!  Let's go back up to Cucumber.

h3. rake cucumber:wip

The --wip switch was used, so I didn't expect anything to pass. These scenarios passed:
(::) passed scenarios (::)

Let's remove that @wip tag from the .feature file


h3. rake cucumber

Looks good.  Time to commit and move on to the home_page.feature
