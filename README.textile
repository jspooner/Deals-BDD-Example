p. Project was generated from rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber-template with some modifications to get by a couple of errors caused by edge rails.
rails new deals -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber-template.rb -T


h1. Create Project
	* or check out tag v0.2.1

h3. rake cucumber:wip
	2 scenarios (2 failed)
	15 steps (2 failed, 8 skipped, 1 undefined, 4 passed)
	0m1.388s

	You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

	Then /^the deal should be saved$/ do
	  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
	end

h3. Implement Step Definitions
	/features/step_definitions/deal_steps.rb
	Then /^the deal should be saved$/ do
	  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
	end

h3. rake cucumber:wip

	p. Ok let's make this pass

	      Can't find mapping from "the new deal page" to a path.
	      Now, go and add a mapping in /Users/jonathanspooner/Dropbox/active/bdd/deals/features/support/paths.rb (RuntimeError)

	p. We don't need to add anything to paths.rb because we can just use the catch all path.

	begin
	  page_name =~ /the (.*) page/
	  ...
	rescue Object => e
	  raise "Can't find mapping from \"#{page_name}\" to a path.\n" +
	    "Now, go and add a mapping in #{__FILE__}"
	end
				 
h3. add route for deals

	routes.rb
	resources :deals

h3. rake cucumber:wip

	Scenario: Create a new deal                                                         # features/deals/create_deals.feature:12
	    Given I am on the new deal page                                                   # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
